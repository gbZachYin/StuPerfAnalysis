The former is for plot and the latter is for dataframe processing in JavaScript. The raw html code is uploaded to the project github repo named ic.html. The collasiable tree and dynamic barchart below it dispaly how the distribution students final letter grade varies as the tree structure changes. 6.3 Instructions for using the plot There are tree deterministic variables (school, x, and y that have the strongest association with final grade among all) with which users can play. The plot is initialized with all nodes being collapsed except for school in the tree and the distribution of all students final grade in the bar chart. Users can click to either expand or collapse a certain nodes. Users can view the tree as a filter. For instance, a tree with nodes x and y expanded meaning that a filter with x=x1 and y=y1 is applied to the whole dataset. Users can hover the mouse over a bar to see the exact number of students getting a certain grade under the current tree structure.
