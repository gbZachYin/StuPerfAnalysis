To combine these two datasets, we spcified the following columns to be used for merging because these columns are basic information of students: Column Name Description school student’s school (binary: ‘GP’ - Gabriel Pereira or ‘MS’ - Mousinho da Silveira) sex student’s sex (binary: ‘F’ - female or ‘M’ - male) age student’s age (numeric: from 15 to 22) address student’s home address type (binary: ‘U’ - urban or ‘R’ - rural) famsize family size (binary: ‘LE3’ - less or equal to 3 or ‘GT3’ - greater than 3) Pstatus parent’s cohabitation status (binary: ‘T’ - living together or ‘A’ - apart) Medu mother’s education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education) Fedu father’s education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education) Mjob mother’s job (nominal: ‘teacher’, ‘health’ care related, civil ‘services’ (e.g. administrative or police), ‘at_home’ or ‘other’) Fjob father’s job (nominal: ‘teacher’, ‘health’ care related, civil ‘services’ (e.g. administrative or police), ‘at_home’ or ‘other’) reason reason to choose this school (nominal: close to ‘home’, school ‘reputation’, ‘course’ preference or ‘other’) guardian student’s guardian (nominal: ‘mother’, ‘father’ or ‘other’) nursery attended nursery school (binary: yes or no) internet Internet access at home (binary: yes or no) 3.2 Data Cleaning After inspecting each variables carefully, we detected that there were outliers in Age and abnormal values in Math and Portuguese grades. Let’s first take a look at the boxplot of age. Most students leave secondary school at 16 or 17. There may be some exceptions and age 19 in this dataset seems reasonable. However, we tend to believe that age 20 and 22 are outliers so it is better to remove data which includes age = 20 or age = 22. Next, let’s move to Math and Portuguese grades in different period. We can see there are grades that equal to 0. Usually, a student with bad performance on a course may result in very low grade, but not 0. A grade of 0 usually appears when the student misses the exam or he/she cheats in exam. However, absence from exam or cheating are not part of factors we are studying. Ih this case, we remove all data with grade of 0. 3.3 Adding New Variable We created two new variables to represent overall performance on Math and Portuguese for a student as: \\(Math\\_Grade = \\frac{1}{3}Math\\_G1 + \\frac{1}{3}Math\\_G2 + \\frac{1}{3}Math\\_G3\\) \\(Por\\_Grade = \\frac{1}{3}Por\\_G1 + \\frac{1}{3}Por\\_G2 + \\frac{1}{3}Por\\_G3\\) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
