One of obvious property is that GP has much more students than MS. Precisely, GP has a total of 349 students of which accounts for 88.35% of the dataset. Possibly due to the small number of students, age range is more narrow in MS (17-21) than that in GP (15-22). In order to compare the age distribution effectively, we calculate relative frequency plot below. In the relative frequency plot, it is clear that students in GP are generally younger that in MS. In addition, age distribution in MS is centered that age group 18 is an absolute majority while age distribution in GP is spread that no age group accounts for more than thirty percent. 5.1.2 Family Education Level In this section, we will analyze the students family education level in the two schools. Since the dataset offers the education level of both parents, we will use the higher one to indicate the family education level of a student, i.e.Â max(Medu, Fedu). According to the plot above, we can find that students failmy education level in GP is generally higher that in MS.
