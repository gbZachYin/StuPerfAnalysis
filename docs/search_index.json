According to our investigation, statistics shows that Portugal remains a low education level in Europe. In 2006, the early school in Portugal has a dropping rate of 40% while the average is 15% for the whole Europe. Students failed many classes and the failure in two core classes, Math and Portuguese, was extremely serious. As Portuguese students has a high failure and dropping out rate, it is very important to figure out what factors have positive/negative impact on students’ performance in different subject. Hence, we want to conduct students’ performance analysis based on student data from two Portuguese schools and hope that we can extract useful information to help us understand how both academic related and non-academic related factors influence a student’s Math and Portuguese grades. In addition, we are also interested in exploring the difference between these two schools in terms of students’ family background. The secondary education in Portugal consists of 3 years schooling which is followed by a higher education. Most students attend public education system where they take several courses such as Science and Art. Mathematics and Portuguese(native language) are two core subjects. For each academic year, students are evaluated in three periods(from the first period to the third period). Exams are based on a 20-points grading scale where 0 is the lowest grade and 20 is full point. In our project, we use data collected in 2005 academic year from two public schools which includes demographic, social and academic related attributes. In the following chapters, we aim to carry out students’ performance analysis and try to answer the following question: - What is the difference between the two schools in terms of students’ family background? - What are some factors that influence students’ academic performance? - Is there an interesting pattern in students’ grades throughout high school?

"],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Students &amp; Schools Analysis 5.2 Factors Affecting Students’ Academic Performance 5.3 Grade in Different Period", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Students &amp; Schools Analysis In this section, we will analyze students’ non-academic data and in two schools. 5.1.1 Age The bar chart plot below displays students’ age distribution in the two schools. One of obvious property is that GP has much more students than MS. Precisely, GP has a total of 349 students of which accounts for 88.35% of the dataset. Possibly due to the small number of students, age range is more narrow in MS (17-21) than that in GP (15-22). In order to compare the age distribution effectively, we calculate relative frequency plot below. In the relative frequency plot, it is clear that students in GP are generally younger that in MS. In addition, age distribution in MS is centered that age group 18 is an absolute majority while age distribution in GP is spread that no age group accounts for more than thirty percent. 5.1.2 Family Education Level In this section, we will analyze the students’ family education level in the two schools. Since the dataset offers the education level of both parents, we will use the higher one to indicate the family education level of a student, i.e. max(Medu, Fedu). According to the plot above, we can find that students’ failmy education level in GP is generally higher that in MS. 5.1.3 Sex &amp; Address In this section, we are going to look at the students’ distribution interms of their gender and home address type (Urban or Rural). In terms of gender, there is nearly no difference between two schools. Both GP and MS have a half-half gender distribution. However, only 20% students in GP are from rural area while there is no significance difference in students’ address type in MS. 5.1.4 Reason of Chosing School In this section, we are going to multivariate analysis in terms of the association between schools, reasons, and family education level. 5.1.4.1 Reason &amp; School According to the plot below, there is association between schools and reasons. The Pearson’s Chi-squared test rejects the hypothesis that two variables are not relevant with a p-value of 0.006, which is consistent with our observation. Consequently, we can obtain that GP has a better reputation in terms of reason of choice while course offered by MS is more attractive. 5.1.4.2 Reason Adr According to the plot below, rural students are more likely to choose MS other than GP due to home and other reasons. A possible explanation would be MS’s study schedule is flexible. On the other hand, urban students tend to choose MS more often than GP because of course. 5.2 Factors Affecting Students’ Academic Performance In this section, we will analyze factors that affect students’ academic performance. Given that we have more than 40 variables in our dataset and all of them are categorical variables after conversion, we decide to use Pearson’s Chi-squared Test to help us narrow down our variable list to be analyzed later. Here we are using the final(the third period) letter grade(Math_Letter_Grade_G3 and Por_Letter_Grade_G3 which is converted from G3 based on the grading system in Portugal) for both Math and Portuguese to reflect student’s academic performance. For each variable in our dataset, we do a Pearson’s Chi-squared Test to see if there is an association between the variable and Math_Letter_Grade or Portuguese_Letter_Grade. We set alpha = 0.01 and the following graphs show factors found by Pearson’s Chi-squared Test that have impact on students’ Math and Portuguese grades, and their correlation with grades: There are some common factors: Medu have positive impact on both Math and Portuguese grade, while schoolsup and failures have negative impact on these two subject grade. Now we can dig deeper into these variables one by one. 5.2.1 Variables Relating to Math Grade Medu (mother’s education:0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education): The mosaic plot shows a strong relationship between Medu and Math_Letter_Grade. When the education for a student’s mother is in level 3 or 4, the student is more likely to get a better grade(A or B). The is saying that, a student’s mother with high level education can be helpful to the student’s achievement on math. failures (number of past class failures: n if 1&lt;=n&lt;3, else 4): The mosaic plot shows that for students who got a grade of A or B, most of them never failed any courses, and few of them failed no more than 2 courses in the past. However, the proportion of students who failed more than 3 courses in the past increases rapidly in the class of grade C or D. This is a logical truth that a student with failures in the past class is prone to get lower grade in the future class. schoolsup(extra educational support): It is clear that, the proportion of students who get extra educational support increases when Math_Letter_Grade goes from A to D. This seems reasonable because students who got low grade need extra educational support to help them improve. absences (absences from school:0 - none, 1 - less than first quantile, 2 - less than second quantile, 3 - less than thrid quantile, 4 - more than third quantile): The plot shows something unexpected. If we only focus on grade B, C and D, it indicates a trend that, fewer absences from school leads to higher grade in math class. But when we move to grade A, a reverse trend applies. We can see that students with grade A are more likely to be absent from school than students with grade B. 5.2.2 Variables Relating to Portuguese Grade Medu (mother’s education:0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education): From the mosaic plot, we can see that the majority of students got grade in class B, C and D. If we focus on these classes only, the proportion of students whose mother’s education is in level 3 or 4 decreases as we move from class B to class D(so as the proportion of Medu = 0 ,1, 2 increases). On the other hand, class A does not seem to follow this trend. However, given that the number of students who got grade A is only 11 and we have 333 students in total, we may need more data to analyze the hidden reason. But it is clear that, the proportion of Medu = 3 or 4(high level education) in class A is relatively high compared to class D and F. In conclusion, we expect to see a student to get a higher grade if his/her mother has received high level education. studytime (weekly study time: 1 - &lt; 2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - &gt;10 hours): The plot reveals that students with higher grade used to spend more time on study. And this is intuitively correct as students spend more time on study, it will increase their knowledge and self-assurance to score higher grade. failures (number of past class failures: n if 1&lt;=n&lt;3, else 4): There is a same trend as how failures affect students’ performance on math. We can’t see much difference in class A and class B regarding the proportion of different class of failures. When we move to class C, D and F, the number of students who failed more than 2 classes in the past increases dramatically. Hence, here ’s the same idea that a student with failures in the past class is prone to get lower grade in the future class. schoolsup(extra educational support): Same as the relationship between schoolsup and Math_Letter_Grade, the proportion of students who get extra educational support increases when Por_Letter_Grade goes from A to D. This seems reasonable because students who got low grade need extra educational support to help them improve. higher (wants to take higher education): The plot shows that students who do not want to pursue a higher level education finally got grade C or D. We cannot say much about a student who want to take higher education, because he/she is equal likely to get grade A, B or C given that the proportion of higher = yes is almost the same in grade A, B and C. However, if a student do not want to take higher education, our data supports that he/she is likely to get a grade C or D. Grade F may be an exception here and we cannot conclude anything for it given that there is only one student get grade F. freetime (free time after school: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high): There is no clear trend to show how freetime affects students’ grade on Protuguese language. Class B and Class C looks almost the same. Interesting fact is that, there is a boost on students’ free time after school when we move to A, D or F, which indicates that big increment in freetime may reflect two total different situations: either a student did well in Portuguese exam or a student got low grade(D or F) in the exam. A possible explanation is that, generally, students with grade A study more strategically which increases their study efficiency and save more time on finishing their homework, so have more free time compared to students with grade B and C who spend more time on study with low efficiency so have less free time. And for students with grade D and F, they just spend few time on study so have more free time. goout (going out with friends: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high): There is a clear trend that students who often going out with friends(goout = 4 or 5) are less likely to get high grade on Portuguese languange exam. Dalc (workday alcohol consumption: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high): The mosaic plot shows that the proportion of Dalc = 3, 4 or 5 increases rapidly in students with grade B, C, D and F which indicates that increment in alcohol consumption in workday will have negative impact on students’ performance on Portuguese. health (current health status: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good): There is a strong relationship between health and Por_Letter_Grade. As students with higher grade, they may tend to be more stressful regarding their study. Moreover, as what we discovered before, students with higher grade have longer weekly study time. Hence, unsurprisingly, we expect to see that students with higher grade have worse health condition than those with lower grade, as spending more time on study and having more stress make negative impact on both physical and mental health. 5.3 Grade in Different Period In this section, we are interested in the grades of Math and Portuguese in different period. We tend to believe that there should be strong relationships among the exam grades in different period, that is if a student can do well in G1 or G2, he/she is expected to do well in G3 as well. Let’s take a look at the alluvial diagram: The alluvial plot represents the change of students’ grades over the academic year(From the first period to the final period). Most students get same letter grade for G1, G2 and G3 which implies that if a student perform well in an exam, he/she is likely to get a high grade in the next exam. In this case, we believe that students’ grades in different periods are high correlated. We can verify this by compute the correlations. This time, we will use Math_G1, Math_G2, Math_G3, Por_G1, Por_G2 and Por_G3 which are numeric grade instead of letter grade. The pair plot reveals that there are strong correlations within math/portuguese grades(approch 1) in difference period.

The collapsible tree and dynamic barchart below display how the distribution of students’ final letter grade varies as the tree structure changes. 6.3 Instructions for using the plot There are three deterministic variables (i.e. Mother’s education level, number of past class failures, and extra educational support) that have the strongest association with final grades regardless of the subject. The plot is initialized with all nodes being collapsed except for Medu in the tree and the distribution of all students’ final grades for Math in the bar chart. Users can click the button at the top to choose the subject (Math or Portuguese). Users can either expand or collapse a certain node. The tree can be viewed as a filter. For instance, a tree with nodes failures-0 and SchoolSup-Yes expanded meaning that the final grade distribution for students who have no courses failed in the past and receive educational support are shown.

After carefully exploring and visualizing our dataset, we conclude that: 1. Medu(mother’s education) has a positive impact on students’ math grade while absences(absence from school), schoolsup(extra educational support) and failures(number of failures in the past classes) have negative impact on student’s math grade. 2. studytime (weekly study time), higher (wants to take higher grade) and Medu(mother’s education) have positive impact on students’ Portuguese language grade while freetime(free time after school), goout(frequency of going out with friends), health(current health status), schoolsup(extra educational support), Dalc(alcohol consumption in weekday) and failures(number of failures in the past classes) have negative impact on students’ Portuguese language grade. Is there an interesting pattern in students’ grades throughout high school? Our discover suggests that there are strong relationship among grade in different period.
