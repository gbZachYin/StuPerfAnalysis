One of obvious property is that GP has much more students than MS. Precisely, GP has a total of 349 students of which accounts for 88.35% of the dataset. Possibly due to the small number of students, age range is more narrow in MS (17-21) than that in GP (15-22). In order to compare the age distribution effectively, we calculate relative frequency plot below. In the relative frequency plot, it is clear that students in GP are generally younger that in MS. In addition, age distribution in MS is centered that age group 18 is an absolute majority while age distribution in GP is spread that no age group accounts for more than thirty percent. 5.1.2 Family Education Level In this section, we will analyze the students family education level in the two schools. Since the dataset offers the education level of both parents, we will use the higher one to indicate the family education level of a student, i.e.Â max(Medu, Fedu). According to the plot above, we can find that students failmy education level in GP is generally higher that in MS. 5.1.3 Sex &amp; Address In this section, we are going to look at the students distribution interms of their gender and home address type (Urban or Rural). In terms of gender, there is nearly no difference between two schools. Both GP and MS have a half-half gender distribution. However, only 20% students in GP are from rural area while there is no significance difference in students address type in MS. 5.1.4 Reason of Chossing School In this section, we are going to multivariate analysis in terms of the association between schools, reasons, and family education level. 5.1.4.1 Reason &amp; School According to the plot below, there is association between schools and reasons. The Pearsons Chi-squared test rejects the hypothesis that two variables are not relevant with a p-value of 0.006, which is consistent with our observation. Consequently, we can obtain that GP has a better reputation in terms of reason of choice while course offered by MS is more attractive. 5.1.4.2 Reason Adr According to the plot below, rural students are more likely to choose MS other than GP due to home and other reasons. A possible explanation would be MSs study schedule is flexible. On the other hand, urban students tend to choose MS more often than GP because of course.
