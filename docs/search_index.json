To combine these two datasets, we spcified the following columns to be used for merging because these columns are basic information of students: Column Name Description school students school (binary: GP - Gabriel Pereira or MS - Mousinho da Silveira) sex students sex (binary: F - female or M - male) age students age (numeric: from 15 to 22) address students home address type (binary: U - urban or R - rural) famsize family size (binary: LE3 - less or equal to 3 or GT3 - greater than 3) Pstatus parents cohabitation status (binary: T - living together or A - apart) Medu mothers education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education) Fedu fathers education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education) Mjob mothers job (nominal: teacher, health care related, civil services (e.g. administrative or police), at_home or other) Fjob fathers job (nominal: teacher, health care related, civil services (e.g. administrative or police), at_home or other) reason reason to choose this school (nominal: close to home, school reputation, course preference or other) guardian students guardian (nominal: mother, father or other) traveltime home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - &lt;15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - &gt;1 hour) nursery attended nursery school (binary: yes or no) internet Internet access at home (binary: yes or no) 3.2 Data Cleaning After carefully inspecting each variable, we detected that there are outliers in Age and abnormal values in Math and Portuguese grades. Lets firstly take a look at the boxplot of age. Given that most students leave secondary school at 16 or 17. There may be some exceptions so that age 19 in this dataset seems reasonable. However, we tend to believe that age 20 and 22 are outliers so it is better to remove data which include age = 20 or age = 22. Next, lets move to Math and Portuguese grades in different period. There are grades that equal to 0. Usually, a student with bad performance on a course may result in very low grade, but not 0. A grade of 0 usually appears when a student missed the exam or he/she cheated in exam. However, absence from exam or cheating are not part of factors we are studying. In this case, we remove all data with grade of 0. 3.3 Variable Transformation 3.3.1 Absences We convert absences variable(numeric from 0 to 93) into categorical variable as follow: If absences = 0, then convert it to 0. If absences &gt; 0 and absences &lt;= first quartile, then convert it to 1. If absences &gt; first quartile and absences &lt;= second quartile, then convert it to 2. If absences &gt; second quartile and absences &lt;= thrid quartile, then convert it to 3. If absences &gt; thrid quartile, then convert it to 4. 3.3.2 Grades We convert all Math and Portuguese grades into categorical variables based on the following grading system for Portuguese high school: Grade Percentage Description 5(A) 90-100 Very good or excellent  best possible grade 4(B) 70-89 Good 3(C) 50-69 Satisfactory  indicates average performance 2(D) 20-49 Unsatisfactory 1(F) 0-19 Poor  lowest possible grade "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
