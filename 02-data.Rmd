# Data sources

Dataset
•Source: the dataset was originally generated by Paulo Cortez and then donated to the Uni-
versity of California Irvine database, which could be found here.
•Explanations:
1. In addition to academic-related variables, the dataset consists of more than 20 demo-
graphic ones. Therefore, we can also explore how non-academic factors impact students’
grades.
2. We can detect the overall pattern of students’ performance by looking at the association
between periodic grades and final grades.
3. There are a lot of family related-variables like family size, parents’ cohabitation status,
and their occupation, offering an opportunity to analyze students’ parents.

Questions:
1. What are some factors that influence students’ academic performance?
2. Is there an interesting pattern in students’ grades throughout high school?
3. What is the difference between the two schools in terms of students’ family background?
