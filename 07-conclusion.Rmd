# Conclusion

**What are some factors that influence students’ academic performance?** \
After carefully exploring and visualizing our dataset, we conclude that:\
1. `Medu`(mother's education) has a positive impact on students' math grade while `absences`(absence from school), `schoolsup`(extra educational support) and `failures`(number of failures in the past classes) have negative impact on student's math grade.\
2. `studytime` (weekly study time), `higher` (wants to take higher grade) and `Medu`(mother's education) have positive impact on students' Portuguese language grade while `freetime`(free time after school), `goout`(frequency of going out with friends), `health`(current health status), `schoolsup`(extra educational support), `Dalc`(alcohol consumption in weekday) and `failures`(number of failures in the past classes) have negative impact on students' Portuguese language grade. \

**Is there an interesting pattern in students’ grades throughout high school?**\
Our discover suggests that there are strong relationship among grade in different period. G1, G2 and G3 are highly correlated.\
