# Introduction

Education is always a key factor in development of a country. According to our investigation, statistics shows that Portugual remains a low education level in Europe. In 2006, the early school in Portugal has a dropping rate of 40% while the average is 15% for the whole Europe. Students failed so many classes and the failure in two core classes, Math and Portuguese, is extremely serious. As Portuguese students has a high failure and dropping out rate, it is very important to figure out what factors have positive/negative impact on students' performance in different subject. In this case, we want to conduct students' performance analysis and hope that we can extract useful information to answer the following questions: \

**1. What is the difference between the two schools in terms of students’ family background?** \
**2. What are some factors that influence students’ academic performance?** \
**3. Is there an interesting pattern in students’ grades throughout high school?**\
