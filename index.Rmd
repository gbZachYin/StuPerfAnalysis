# Introduction

Education is always a key factor in development of a country. According to our investigation, statistics shows that Portugal remains a low education level in Europe. In 2006, the early school in Portugal has a dropping rate of 40% while the average is 15% for the whole Europe. Students failed many classes and the failure in two core classes, Math and Portuguese, was extremely serious. As Portuguese students has a high failure and dropping out rate, it is very important to figure out what factors have positive/negative impact on students' performance in different subject. Hence, we want to conduct students' performance analysis based on student data in two Portuguese schools and hope that we can extract useful information to help us understand how both academic related and non-academic related factors influence a student's Math and Portuguese grades. \

There is 3-year-schooling in the secondary education in Portugal which is followed by a higher education. Most students attend public education system where they take several courses such as Science and Art. Mathematics and Portuguese(native language) are two core subjects. For each academic year, students are evaluated in three periods(from the first period to the third period). Exam is based on a 20-points grading scale where 0 is the lowest grade and 20 is full point. In our project, we use data collected in 2005 academic year from two public school which includes demographic, social and academic related attributes. \

In the following chapters, we aim to carry out students' performance analysis and try to answer the following question: \
- **What is the difference between the two schools in terms of students’ family background?** \
- **What are some factors that influence students’ academic performance?** \
- **Is there an interesting pattern in students’ grades throughout high school?**\
